# How to Edit Subscriptions and Monthly Budget

## üìù Issue 1: AI Categorization Not Working for YouTube

### Problem:
YouTube subscriptions are categorized as "Other" instead of "Entertainment"

### Solution:
The AI service was already updated to recognize YouTube. Try these steps:

1. **Hard refresh your browser** to clear cache:
   - Press **Ctrl + Shift + R** (or **Ctrl + F5**)
   - Or clear browser cache completely

2. **When adding a subscription**:
   - Type "YouTube" in the name field
   - Click the **‚ú® sparkle icon** (AI Analyze button)
   - It should now suggest "Entertainment" with 85-95% confidence

3. **If still not working**, manually select category:
   - In the dropdown, choose "Entertainment"

## üí≥ Issue 2: M-Pesa Shows as "Card" After Creation

### Problem:
You select M-Pesa as payment method, but it displays as "Card" after creation

### Root Cause:
The subscription form is not sending `paymentMethod` to the backend API, so the backend doesn't store it.

### Solution:

**Location to edit**: `Frontend/components/subscription-form.tsx`

The form needs to be updated to include payment method in the API request. Currently it only sends:
```typescript
{
  name: formData.name,
  price: formData.cost,
  billing_date: formData.nextPayment,
  status: "active"
}
```

It should also send `payment_method`:
```typescript
{
  name: formData.name,
  price: formData.cost,
  billing_date: formData.nextPayment,
  status: "active",
  payment_method: formData.paymentMethod  // ADD THIS
}
```
