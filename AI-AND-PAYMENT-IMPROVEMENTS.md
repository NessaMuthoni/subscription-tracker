# AI Categorization & Payment Balance Improvements

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced AI Service Categorization ü§ñ

**File:** `Frontend/lib/ai-service.ts`

#### What was fixed:
- YouTube and other services were being categorized as "Other" instead of "Entertainment"
- Limited keyword coverage for popular services

#### Improvements:
- ‚úÖ **Expanded Entertainment keywords**: Added YouTube variations (youtube, yt), ShowMax, DSTV, HBO, Paramount+, Peacock, Apple Music, Apple TV+, Tidal, SoundCloud
- ‚úÖ **New category - Education**: Udemy, Coursera, Skillshare, Masterclass, LinkedIn Learning, Pluralsight, DataCamp, Codecademy, Duolingo
- ‚úÖ **New category - News**: Medium, Substack, newspapers, journals, magazines
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced Productivity**: Added Canva, Figma, Jira, Confluence, Monday.com
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced Social**: Added TikTok, X Premium, dating apps
- ‚úÖ **Better matching logic**: Service name gets priority (85-95% confidence), description matching gets lower confidence (70-80%)
- ‚úÖ **Immediate return**: Returns as soon as first match is found for better accuracy

#### How it works:
```typescript
// When you type "YouTube Premium":
1. Converts to lowercase: "youtube premium"
2. Checks Entertainment keywords: ["youtube", "yt", ...]
3. Finds match: "youtube"
4. Returns: { category: "Entertainment", confidence: 0.92 }
```

- ‚úÖ **Smart initialization**: Merges user preferences with defaults to ensure nothing is missing
- ‚úÖ **Better toggle handling**: Properly creates payment method preferences even if they don't exist
- ‚úÖ **Demo mode notice**: Added blue alert explaining that balances are simulated (for demo purposes)

#### Default Payment Methods:
1. **M-Pesa** (Smartphone icon) - Kenyan mobile money
2. **Credit/Debit Card** (CreditCard icon) - Bank cards
3. **PayPal** (Wallet icon) - Digital wallet

#### How to use:
1. Go to **Settings** page
2. Enable **"Enable Balance Checking"** toggle
3. Enable individual payment methods (M-Pesa, Card, PayPal)
4. Click **"Check Balances"** button

## Troubleshooting

**Problem**: YouTube still showing as "Other"
- **Solution**: Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) to clear cache
- The AI service is client-side, so changes apply immediately

**Problem**: Payment methods not showing
- **Solution**: 
  1. Check if "Enable Balance Checking" is ON
  2. Try logging out and back in
  3. Check browser console for errors

**Problem**: Balance check fails
- **Solution**: This is expected in demo mode - errors are simulated to test error handling
